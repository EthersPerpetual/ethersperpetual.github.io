                <span>2. The principal will be unfrozen 10 days after the whole time of your bet. After unfreezing, no dividend will be calculated and node rewards will be calculated normally. You can withdraw at any time and no node rewards will be calculated after withdrawing. If the hierarchical relationship of performance reset remains unchanged before rejoining, the node dividend will be recalculated according to the new performance.</span><br>
                <span>3.Membership level is v1-v5, V1: 1-5eth, V2: 6-10eth, V3; 11-15eth, V4: 16-20eth, V5: 21-30eth.</span><br>

When the bet amount of your account is greater than or equal to the recommended friend's bet amount, the node reward is calculated based on the recommended friend's bet amount. In addition, the node reward needs to be multiplied by the node level coefficient. V1 is 30%, V2 is 50%, V3 is 70%, V4 is 80%, and V5 is 100%. For example, if a recommends B, a bet 5eth, and B bet 30eth, then a gets a daily bonus of (5 * 1 / 100) * 20% * 30%.</span><br>

The higher the daily bonus and the corresponding node bonus, the minimum daily bonus is the basic proportion described above, and the maximum is three times of the basic proportion.</span><br>
                <span>10. Lucky person mechanism: 80% of the profits to be withdrawn will be distributed according to eth, and 20% will form eth gold to reward participants. Eth gold and eth are exchanged at a ratio of 1:1. For example, one eth 0.8 earnings can be withdrawn and 0.2 earnings can be exchanged into eth gold. If the bet is successful, the re investment is successful, or an activated account is recommended, the chance to extract eth can be increased once, without capping. Eth gold cannot withdraw cash. 0.5 eth gold can participate in the lottery once.</span><br>
                <span>11. Accompanier mechanism: 1% of the player's bet will enter the accompanier fund. Players who make three rounds of continuous re investment (click the "re investment" button to count as re investment) will be marked as accompaniers, one round every 10 days. All accompanies share the fund equally and enjoy a dividend every 10 days.<br>
                1. There are three small reward pools, with V3 prize pool accounting for 20%, V4 prize pool accounting for 30%, and V5 prize pool accounting for 50%.<br>
                2. When the player's bonus level reaches V3 or above and has been re invested for 3 consecutive rounds, the bonus pool of corresponding level can be divided equally according to the player's bonus level. If the player's bonus level is lower than V3, no bonus bonus will be obtained.</span><br>
                <span>12. Dynamic equilibrium mechanism: when a large number of players rush in, the dynamic equilibrium mechanism will be automatically opened to avoid the impact of centralized betting on the overall data. When players participate in the queue, the queue amount does not calculate the dividend income, does not calculate the node income, and the queue amount can be withdrawn at any time.</span><br>
                <span>13. Successor mechanism: when the contract is 0, the smart contract will take out eth from the special account to reward the last 30 players with the bet amount, which is twice of the bet amount.</span><br>
<span>14. Nirvana mechanism: if the contract balance is 0, the restart mechanism will be started automatically. When restarting, everyone's account will return to 0, but the node relationship will not change, and a new round of game will start.
